# FactorialMultiThread

## 📝 Description :
FactorialMultiThread is a project designed to showcase the power of concurrent programming. It calculates the factorial of various numbers using both single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches and compares their performances.

## ✨ Features :
🔹 Factorial calculation using a single-threaded approach.

🔹 Factorial calculation using a multi-threaded approach.

🔹 Comparison of execution times between single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches.

## 💽 Installation :
Clone the repository:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Bliaxx/FactorialMultiThread.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.

## 🚀 Usage :
Run the compiled program. The program will display the factorial results for various values along with the execution times for both single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches.
